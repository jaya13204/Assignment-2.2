1.HDFS:

*Hadoop Distributed File System is used for storage purpose in hadoop.
*HDFS is built using the Java language
*It consists of single namenode,called as master which manages the namespace of filesystem.
*HDFS stores files across the collection of servers in a cluster.
*There are number of data nodes which manages the storage to the nodes they run.
*HDFS is a scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed storage system.
*HDFS is  designed to run on commodity hardware.
*Hadoop supports shell-like commands to interact with HDFS directly.
*HDFS detects and compensates for hardware issues.

2.Hadoop cluster:

*Hadoop cluster boosts the speed of data analysis applications.
 *A computer cluster used for Hadoop is called Hadoop Cluster. 
*Hadoop clusters are scalable and highly resistant to failures.
*Hadoop cluster is designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of 
unstructured data.
*Hadoop clusters are composed of three types of node: 
-master nodes
-worker nodes
-client nodes. 
*Hadoop cluster will run in low cost commodity hardwares.
*Clusters of three or more machines typically use a single NameNode and ResourceManager
 with all the other nodes as slave nodes.

3.HDFS Blocks:

*Hadoop distributed file system  stores the data in terms of blocks.
*Hard Disk has concentric circles which form tracks.
*The default size of hdfs block is 64MB.
*HDFS blocks are larger in size in order to reduce the cost of seek time.
*Blocks are easy to replicate and there by providing fault tolerance and hign availability.
*The default replication factor of blocks is 3.
*Blocks are linked to the file through INode. Each block is given a timestamp 
that is used to determine whether a replica is current.
